A few minutes ago, a friend of mine shared something good on facebook. He use Solaar to get battery information from his Logitech mouse. So, what is Solaar?

Quoted from Solaar website:

	"Solaar is a Linux device manager for Logitech's Unifying Receiver peripherals."

It gives you information about your device's technical detail like Wireless PID, Protocol, Polling Rate, Serial number, even your device's firmware. And of course, it gives battery information. Nice isn't it? Well, I won't worry about my mouse battery anymore since Solaar also provide an applet.
