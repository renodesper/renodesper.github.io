For about a month I've been busy building a Django project. Even though everyday I work with python, but I never ever try any framework that is build with it. I can not say it's hard, but with all those "jobs" in my office, this month is the busiest time for me to took another project (I never know that I will be this busy). Deadline is in the corner and the project is about 75%. I hope I can finish it as fast as possible.

**never stop until the bell ringing**
