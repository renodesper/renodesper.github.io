## flazz/vim-colorschemes

vim-colorschemes is a collection of colorscheme from vim.org. My favorite is Tomorrow-Night-Eighties which looks like this:

This plugin has a lot of colorschemes, I don't think I will ever have a chance to try all of it

## eiginn/netrw

netrw is a must-have plugin if you often connect to remote server. Instead of editing file on the remote server, you can use netrw to do some editing right in vim.

## fholgado/minibufexpl.vim

Looking for buffer in vim is a bit hard for me. I often forget which buffer I'm editing and it makes my typespeed a bit slow. minibufexpl helped me a lot with providing tab-like buffer.

## godlygeek/tabular

Sometimes, we want to align a few line which have a specific character. Let's say that I want to align 5 lines based on equal symbol. After I block those line in visual mode I can use :Tabularize /= to align them. We can also map it into another combination. In my case, I use this kind of mapping:

## groenewege/vim-less

vim-less give us syntax highlighting, auto completion, and so on. Nothing special but useful when we want to edit .less file.
