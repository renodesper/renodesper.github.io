Today, I tried something different. Well, I just want to improve my programming language and english but I don't have any idea about what should I do. And I thought why don't I learn by documenting what I have done. Maybe I will learn more serious to avoid making mistake when I write it.

Here we go, a blog made from ghost with everything about everything. Oh right, I will use 2 different languages in this blog. In case I forgot some words in english, I will use Bahasa Indonesia instead.
